# LinkedIn-Job-Analytics
Scrape and analyze data from LinkedIn by using python libraries 


I used pandas, selenium, beautifulsoup, time, openpyxl libraries of python of create this project.

Pandas are used to store different values in proper format.

LinkedIn website is dynamic in nature. So Selenium is needed for continuous login to that website. ( connection establish )

BeautifulSoup is used to extract the data from the webpage.

Openpyxl is used to convert the dataframe into excel sheet.

In the project, 3 different table are created with stores the details of job and its company job details and many more information.

After creation of this excel sheet. I used SQL for finding some insights from the data like highest job ooenings, maximum followers of company and which job type is more posted on the linkedin portal.

All these insights are visualized by using Tableau for better imagination.
